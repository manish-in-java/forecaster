                p <b>Forecasting</b> is an estimation process that enables businesses to predict
                  | important parameters, such as, demand, sales, profits, etc. Good
                  | forecasts enable businesses to plan better and make adjustments to their
                  | strategy, if required, well in advance.
                p Forecasting is affected by a number of factors, including the nature of
                  | the product, seasonality, customer preferences, socioeconomic environment,
                  | competitor dynamics, etc.
                p Forecasting is usually performed using actual data collected in the past.
                  | For example, a sales forecast can be performed using past sales data.
                  | Similarly, a price forecast for a stock traded on a stock exchange can be
                  | performed using the historical prices for the stock. Each data point is
                  | called an <i>Observation</i> and the collection of observations, based
                  | on which the forecast is generated a <i>Sample</i>.
                p There are many forecasting techniques. Each technique, known as a
                  | <i>Forecast Model</i>, (or <i>Model</i> in short) attempts to
                  | analyze the sample in a certain way so as to be as accurate as possible.
                  | Each model amplifies or suppresses one or more pattern underlying the sample
                  | set. As a result, different types of samples benefit from different
                  | forecast models.
