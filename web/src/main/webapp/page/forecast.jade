                p Businesses that deal with physical goods are usually required
                  | to maintain minimum quantities of products so that they can
                  | fulfill customer orders and not have to decline orders. As
                  | there is cost associated with storage of goods, and further
                  | costs may be incurred on account of monitoring the goods
                  | condition while they are stored, it is desirable to maintain
                  | the minimum possible quantities required for individual
                  | products  to fulfill orders, such that the cost is minimized,
                  | and order fulfilment is maximized.
                p <b>Inventory Forecasting</b> is a discipline under <i>Supply-chain and Logistics</i>
                  | function that aims to analyze past sales trends to project
                  | inventory holding into the future. The task of analyzing
                  | past sales trends to generate future projections is known
                  | as <b>Forecasting</b>. Given that products have different
                  | lifecycle and demand patterns, and businesses have
                  | varying production capabilities and storage options
                  | available to them, forecasting relies on using different
                  | analytical techniques, called <b>forecast models</b> to
                  | predict trends for different types of products.
